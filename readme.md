# Contact Application
### By: Andrew Mekhail

## Description:
This is a simple contact application that allows users to add new contacts, view all the existing contacts and delete any of them. This project was created using express.js. When loaded in the application, the index page is the main home page and it shows your contact with 3 buttons next to it; "edit", "view, and "delete". When you click on edit, you are brought to another page and you can edit all 3 elements of the contact, which are the name, email, and phone number. When you click on "view", it brings you to a separate page and shows you all 3 details of that contact. When you click on delete, it instantly deletes the contact entirely.
